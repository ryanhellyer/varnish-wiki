Welcome to Varnish Wiki!
========================

Here you will find all the resources you need to start using Varnish.
Let's get you started from development to production!

Varnish is a reverse-proxy HTTP accelerator designed for heavily consumed
API endpoints and also for dynamic, heavy-content websites. Varnish is very 
flexible and as such can be used:

- As a caching engine
- As a load balancer
- As a web application firewall
- As an Edge authentication and authorization mechanism
- For HTTP routing
- For hotlinking protection
- As a DDoS attack defender
- and more.

Varnish is currently used by high-profile, high-traffic sites such as Facebook, 
Wikipedia, Vimeo, Twitter, Tumblr, The Guardian, VG.no and many others. More
than 2.5 million sites run the software.
